Welcome! 

Thanks for checking out my blog! This is the first official post!  Yes, there’s a ways to go before this thing really takes shape so please be patient.  I promise,  this is going to be the coolest page to ever hit the internet! Ever!  So many exclamation points!

Goals:

- Build a strong online presence
- Continue to build upon my development skill set 
- Write about my experiences as a project manager and scrum master
- Have a repository of content to look back to.
- Post multiple times a week and continually build upon my experiences.
- Keep posts short, sweet as well as keeping my code clean and DRY.
- Have my friends write about their specialities as contributors.
- Gain some kind of incremental following and bring value to others.

Yes, these goals are some what broad and I’ll continue to iterate, define and  build upon them to become a better developer, project manager, Scrum Master/Coach.

About the page itself:

This blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github pages.  Once this thing looks presentable and has enough content I’ll take down my current site benjaminschachter.com from go daddy and use that domain here.  I guess you could say this is purely a staging site for the time being.


That’s about it for now, stay tuned.

Cheers!

Benjamin
