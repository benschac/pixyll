Well hello there, you must really like me if you’re back reading post number two.  Or maybe you want to see a gif of a bunch of corgis, I have those too.

Building software, is now one of the most glorified, dramatized fields to work in today.  What was once “those weird guys in the back of the office” is now “those guys who built that app that changed everything that sold for $100 million”.  We often talk about the people who design, write content and engineer the digital product.  There is one position that is rarely spoken of but puts all of the pieces of product development together, who’s title happens to be The Project Manager.

As a Project Manager, I get to have a unique perspective and role within the building of the product.  I don’t physically build the end product. I guide all of the players working on the project to the desired outcome at the desired time for the desired price.  It’s not just about getting from A to B.  It’s about making sure the experience is smooth for everyone who’s involved within the Project (Business Stake Owners, Designers, Developers, Clients, Users and or the Agency that’s commissioned to do the work).

Yes, this job isn’t technical. However, it does require excellent organization, communication, and the ability to shift on a dime. Most importantly, it’s the person you need to shift on a dime and communicate in a way to make sure the project effectively.

Project Management works within all levels of the project.   Birds eye to looking for that needle in the hay stack.  The Project Manager is first and foremost taking ownership of the product and the process in which it’s being built.

Your boss owns the car. You’re the guy in the driver seat.  You want to make sure your boss trusts you enough to get from point A to B without damaging the automobile and making it look attractive while driving down the street so other talented people want to get in the automobile and brag about it as well. 

Here’s a play-by-play of the position:

Scoping work:
Depending on what organization you work on, a Project Manager might be responsible for determining what needs to be and what doesn’t need to be built. From a general point of view how long this should take.  The Project Manager alongside the sales team sets the tone for the project and the client. An over scoped project could make the agency look greedy and cost them work.  An under scoped project might cause the client to feel like they’ve been mislead, and now have to pay for more work. 

Communicating early and often with developer and designers at this point is critical to the success of any project.

Defining a scope of work:
After a Project Manager figures out what needs to be built, they need to define exactly what is and isn’t being built.  The devil truly is in the detail.  Project Managers need to know what they are and are not supporting.  What’s going into that feature set and what isn’t.  How much design time is needed and the list goes on and on.

Planning Work:
After work is defined, a Project Manager needs to plan how work is going to be done.  Who is going to do this work? What’s this person's availability? When does the client need this work to be finished? When do we need to show the client work?  How are we going to show a long and short term view of the project to the client?

Keeping Progress:
The questions that most of a Project Manager's salary is really beholden to is where are we in the process? Are we over or under budget? Are we going to make our deadlines? Have we been paid? Is everything working the way it should? Is the client happy?  This is probably 60% of the job.  If you’re looking to get into the field, make sure you can answer these questions all of the time.

Making Sure It Works:
It might sound silly, but you need to make sure every link, breakpoint, animation anything on the page works on every browser that the contract specifies.  Sounds easy, but you’d be surprised how much can go wrong. 

What happens after work is done:
A Project Manager stays with their project until completion.  If anything is needed, something under warranty breaks, the client wants a new feature the Project Manager is the one answering the call and starting the development life cycle all over again.

Bonus: Communication:
I lied. This actually isn’t a bonus, it’s really all that matters.  If a Project Manager cannot communicate, everything else above is moot.  It doesn’t matter how well you do any of the above.  If the people who matter can’t understand what you’re talking about, well yeah, you get the idea. 

All of this sounds easy, so why is this job so dang hard?

It’s not easy, but all of these steps that need to be considered a Project Manager must do for multiple clients, for varying work, deadlines, different team members. Some make it work, not just work for them, but for the whole company.  You might need a designer for one thing and promise a client one thing, but maybe another Project Manager needs that person for something critical and you need to put your work on hold.

My point is if you can manage a lot of work, personalities, goals, deadlines and communicate them in an understandable and articulate fashion, this is the field for you. 

Again, I want to keep this short, sweet and fun.  Managing a software project might not be sexy as figuring out why you’re script cannot load that object, but I swear we’re not all so nerdy. 


Cheers,

Benjamin
