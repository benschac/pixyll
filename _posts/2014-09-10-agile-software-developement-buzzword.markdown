What is Agile software development? What does it do? Why should I care?  It sounds like some buzzword I heard on that HBO show Silicon Valley (RIO, Burndown Chart, A/B testing, Ruby on Rails, etc).  Here are some helpful tips to assist you with the definition and understanding of Agile: 

A great place to start is the Agile Manifesto which states:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
Working software over comprehensive documentation.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan.

Agile Manifesto doesn’t state that everything to the right should be thrown away.  The items on the left just contain more value than their counterparts on the right. *Think US politics, : ) 

This is the core of Agile.  Yes, there’s more to it. Agile has many different flavors for different teams and project needs.  This is important stuff and if you’re working within the software field, you might want to internalize this bit.  Unless you know what’s important in Agile, anyone could call anything Agile and you wouldn’t know the difference.

Know the rules of the game that you’re playing, regardless if it’s software or Bocci ball.

It’s also helpful to know how these principles of the Agile Manifesto were created:
The highest priority of Agile is to satisfy the customer early and continuous delivery of valuable software. 
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.  Agile process harness change for the customers competitive advantage.
Deliver working software frequently from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with a preference on a shorter time scale.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
Build projects around motivated people, give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile process promotes sustainable development.  The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
Simplicity;  the art of maximizing the work not completed is essential.
The best design and requirements emerge from self organizing teams.  
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

There’s a lot here, take some time and mull it over, research, maybe talk it over with your grandmother. Or not. However, this is what people are talking about when they bring up that special term, “Agile”.

So who really cares? Why is Agile the hottest thing since that burnt pizza you made last week? 

Technology is constantly changing.  If it takes you 18 months to build out your product and you’ve set your business rules a year ago, what are the odds that your product is still going to be relevant?  Additionally, the software industry has an infamous reputation of bad communication, over promising and under delivering.  Agile is the response to that reputation.




Here’s what the old way of doing things looked like:

Here is what the Agile process looks like:

I’m going to get into more detail about just exactly how Agile processes work, tools of the trade and how we work these principles into our day-to-day incoming posts.  As you can see, this image gives a flexible, iterative work environment that responds well to change.  

Takeaways:
Agile is a thing, not some buzz word.
Agile is flexible and welcomes change.
Agile has it’s own Manifesto and principles that you should look into, especially if you’re looking to switch to Agile builds.
This is an intro to start the blog which I will be updating on a consistent basis.  I intentionally left out many concepts on the subject so we can dive deeper into Agile in later posts. 


These are some helpful resources to start your Agile journey.


Happy Agil-ing!
